#Pipven: Simplify Python Virtual Environment and Package Management
Pipven is a simple yet powerful script that helps you manage Python virtual environments and install/uninstall packages using pip. It aims to streamline package management within your projects by providing an intuitive interface with additional features such as colored output and support for requirements.txt.

Key Features
User-Friendly Interface : Uses emojis (✔ for success and ✖ for errors) and colored text (green for successful commands, red for errors) for clear and visually appealing output.
Automatic Virtual Environment Management : Automatically creates and manages a virtual environment if it doesn't already exist.
Support for Requirements Files : Easily install multiple packages from a requirements.txt file.
Install/Uninstall Packages : Install or uninstall individual packages with ease.
List Installed Packages : View all installed packages in the virtual environment.
Upgrade Packages : Upgrade specific packages or all outdated packages.
Generate Requirements File : Freeze installed packages into a requirements.txt file for reproducibility.
Cross-Platform Compatibility : Works seamlessly on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and can be adapted for Windows.
